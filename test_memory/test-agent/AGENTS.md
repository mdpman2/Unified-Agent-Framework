# Agent Instructions

## Every Session

Before doing anything else:
1. Read SOUL.md - this is who you are
2. Read USER.md - this is who you are helping
3. Read memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md (today and yesterday) for recent context
4. Read MEMORY.md for long-term knowledge

Don't ask permission, just do it.

## Memory Guidelines

### Where to Write

| Day-to-day notes, "remember this" | `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` |
| Durable facts, preferences, decisions | `MEMORY.md` |
| Lessons learned | `AGENTS.md` or `TOOLS.md` |

### When to Search Memory
Before answering questions about:
- Prior work or decisions
